QuickStack is a self-hosted PaaS solution designed to simplify the management of your applications on one or more virtual private servers (VPS).

Developed as part of a student project by [glueh-wyy-huet](https://github.com/glueh-wyy-huet) and [biersoeckli](https://github.com/biersoeckli) at the [Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences](https://ost.ch/), QuickStack provides a scalable and cost-effective alternative to commercial cloud PaaS offerings like Vercel, Digital Ocean App Platform or Azure App Service.

## Key Features

* **One-Command Installation:** Deploy QuickStack on a VPS with a single command.
* **Git Integration:** Deploy applications directly from public or private Git repositories.
* **Docker Container Deployment:** Deploy Docker containers from a Docker Hub, a public or a private registry.
* **Live Logging:** Debug running containers with live log streams.
* **Web Terminal:** Access a web-based terminal directly within the container for debugging.
* **SSL Certificate Management:** Automatic SSL certificate generation via Let's Encrypt.
* **Resource Management:** Set resource limits (CPU, RAM, storage) for each application.
* **Monitoring Dashboard:** Track resource consumption and application performance.
* **Backups:** Create backups of application data and databases to a S3-compatible storage.
* **Cluster Support:** Scale applications across multiple VPS nodes.
* **Persistent Storage:** Cluster-wide persistent storage volumes for applications.
